<!--Later use for search functionality-->
                <!--
                <form class="d-flex" role="search">
                  <input class="form-control me-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
                  <button class="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit">Search</button>
                </form>-->

The above will be used when we integrate Elasticsearch to the site

The product dropdown:
<!--Later use when we want to highlight our best sellers-->
                  <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" role="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">
                      Products
                    </a>
                    <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                      <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a></li>
                      <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
                      <li><hr class="dropdown-divider"></li>
                      <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
            
Using a Bootstrap navbar dropdown to highlight specific products, such as featuring popular items, is a great idea to draw attention to key products and encourage sales. Here's how you can implement it effectively:

1. **Labeling**: Label the dropdown appropriately, such as "Featured Products" or "Popular Items," to indicate to users that these are special selections.

2. **Product Showcase**: Include high-quality images, brief descriptions, and possibly discounted prices of the selected products within the dropdown menu. This gives users a glimpse of the featured items and entices them to explore further.

3. **Limited Selection**: Limit the number of products displayed in the dropdown to a manageable amount, ideally around 3 to 5 items. This prevents overwhelming users with too many choices and keeps the focus on the highlighted products.

4. **Variety**: Ensure that the featured products represent a diverse range of categories or types to cater to different user preferences. This increases the chances of capturing the interest of a broader audience.

5. **Call to Action**: Include clear calls to action (CTAs) such as "Shop Now" or "View Details" buttons alongside each featured product. These CTAs prompt users to take action and explore the products further.

6. **Regular Updates**: Periodically update the featured products to keep the content fresh and relevant. This encourages repeat visits from users who may be curious about new additions to the featured selection.

By using a Bootstrap navbar dropdown to highlight specific products, you can effectively showcase popular items, drive traffic to key product pages, and potentially increase sales and conversions on your ecommerce store.
